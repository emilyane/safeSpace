# safeSpace

Overview:

The app is a project targeted for refugees and migrants who are either unhoused or hosted in a Fedasil center to find welcoming spaces that host activites and safe accommodation. The app has a user who can search, add, update and delete an activity or accommodation. The admin can delete users. 

The project has three entities:

1. User
2. Activities
3. Accommodation

There are six controllers:

Accomodation
Activity
Admin
Home
Register
Security

Functions that work:

The Security and Registration controllers work in connection with the Data Fixtures and properly save in the database. 
The Activity and Accomodation controllers need to be built. 

The template is not properly connecting and I have tried to solve this issue alone and with other classmates and cannot find the solution. I have searched in the permissions and settings of Symfony, Composer and Zend and cannot find the problem. 


I have had issues with Xdebug and Composer that slowed down my work and caused me to restart my project twice.
